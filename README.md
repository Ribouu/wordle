# wordle
Just a little project to see if I can apply what I learn everyday in class.

This is the wordle game (motus in french). Feel free to use the code.

## Setup and Run

Requires **Python 3.7+**. You can download the latest version of Python [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/).


There's no necessary package to install, I only import random in the code.

I got the data from [David Louapre](github.com/scienceetonnante) in his [WordleSutom project](github.com/scienceetonnante/WordleSutom), as I couldn't find any other list of words on the internet.

Game obviously inspired from [Wordle](https://www.nytimes.com/games/wordle/index.html), and the French games [Sutom](https://sutom.nocle.fr/#) and [Le Mot](https://wordle.louan.me/).
