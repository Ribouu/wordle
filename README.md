# wordle
Just a little project to see if I can apply what I learn everyday in class.

This is the wordle game (motus in french). Feel free to use the code.

## Setup and Run

Requires **Python 3.7+**. You can download the latest version of Python [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/).


There's no necessary package to install, I only import random and sys in the code.
 
However, in windows cmd, the console does not interpret the ANSI codes for the colors or the lines like "sys.stdout.write(u"\u001b[2F\u001b[2K")". So it's preferable to run the program in a IDE, like [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/).

I got the data from [David Louapre](github.com/scienceetonnante) in his [WordleSutom project](github.com/scienceetonnante/WordleSutom), as I couldn't find any other list of words on the internet.

Game obviously inspired from [Wordle](https://www.nytimes.com/games/wordle/index.html), and the French games [Sutom](https://sutom.nocle.fr/#) and [Le Mot](https://wordle.louan.me/).
